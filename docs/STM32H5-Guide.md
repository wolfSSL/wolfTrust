# STM32H5 Guide

This guide covers the NUCLEO-H563ZI reference board. Option-byte and
product-state changes can erase the device or remove debug access. Read the
current state first, keep the board in a recoverable state during development,
and never enter the permanent Locked state on a development board.

Supported silicon is STM32H563 revision X or W (DBGMCU_IDCODE REV_ID 0x1007 or
0x100F); the Secure image halts at boot on engineering samples A (0x1000) and
Z (0x1001), which need more flash wait states during read-while-write than the
port sets (ST ES0565 2.2.9), and on any other IDCODE.

## Required tools

- NUCLEO-H563ZI with ST-Link and USB serial
- STM32CubeProgrammer CLI
- Linux with Bash and GNU userland
- Docker and the configured build container for Secure and guest builds
- pyOCD with STM32H563 support
- a host-visible `arm-none-eabi-nm`, or an override in `ARM_NM`
- Python 3
- a serial device, default `/dev/ttyACM0`

Overrides:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `STM32_CLI` | Full path to `STM32_Programmer_CLI` |
| `STM32_CP` | STM32CubeProgrammer binary directory |
| `H5_SERIAL` | UART device |
| `WT_H5_DOCKER_IMAGE` | Container image holding the build toolchain |
| `WT_DA_DIR`, `WT_DA_OBK`, `WT_DA_KEY`, `WT_DA_CERT`, `WT_DA_PWD` | Debug Authentication material |

## Read-only preflight

Read the product state and Secure watermarks:

```sh
tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh status
tests/target/h5_lock_preflight.sh
```

The preflight validates an Open device with TrustZone and the OEM immutable
root-of-trust boot path enabled. It confirms that SECWM fields are present and
requires TrustedPackageCreator; its Debug Authentication help check is
informational. It does not compare watermark values, inspect the Debug
Authentication key, certificate, or OBK material, validate permitted actions,
or exercise recovery. Manually compare the printed values with the TrustZone
perimeter table below and validate the remaining items separately before
advancing lifecycle state. The preflight writes nothing.

## Reference flash layout

The current hardware runner uses:

| Image or region | Address or range |
| --- | ---: |
| wolfBoot | `0x0C000000` |
| wolfTrust | `0x0C060000` |
| wolfBoot update partition | `0x0C100000-0x0C13FFFF` |
| wolfBoot swap sector | `0x0C140000` |
| Guest 0 | `0x080A0000` |
| Guest 1 | `0x080E0000` |
| WRP-covered guest region | `0x080A0000-0x080FFFFF` |

These addresses come from `tests/target/run_h5_hardware.sh` and its
exported build variables. Use that runner for image assembly and flashing so
the build and flash addresses stay paired.

## TrustZone perimeter

`tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh set-perimeter` programs the
reference option bytes:

| Option | Value | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `TZEN` | `0xB4` | Enable TrustZone |
| `BOOT_UBE` | `0xB4` | Select the OEM immutable-root boot path |
| `SWAP_BANK` | `0x0` | Use the expected bank mapping |
| `SECWM1_STRT` | `0x0` | Start Secure bank-1 watermark |
| `SECWM1_END` | `0x4F` | Cover the complete wolfBoot and wolfTrust Secure region through `0x0809FFFF` |
| `SECWM2_STRT` | `0x0` | Start Secure bank-2 watermark |
| `SECWM2_END` | `0x7F` | Cover the configured bank-2 Secure region |

Changing `TZEN` can mass-erase the device. The command requires an
explicit write confirmation:

```sh
WT_LOCK_CONFIRM=1 tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh set-perimeter
```

Do not copy these values to another STM32H5 part without checking its reference
manual, flash geometry, and intended image layout.

## Guest flash write protection

STM32H563 bank-1 WRP bits each cover four 8 KiB sectors, and a cleared bit
means protected. The reference value `WRPSGn1=0x000FFFFF` clears bits
20 through 31, protecting sectors `0x50-0x7F` and therefore the whole
guest region.

The `provisioning_ctrl.sh set-wrp` helper deliberately applies WRP only while
the device is Open. Treat that as wolfTrust's conservative supported workflow,
not the complete silicon rule: current ST guidance makes WRP nonmodifiable in
TZ-Closed, Closed, and Locked, and RM0481 separately defines the
`FLASH_WRPSGNxR.UNLOCK` condition. Program guest images first, then protect
them:

```sh
WT_LOCK_CONFIRM=1 tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh set-wrp
```

Read back the live value:

```sh
STM32_CLI="${STM32_CLI:-$HOME/STMicroelectronics/STM32Cube/STM32CubeProgrammer/bin/STM32_Programmer_CLI}"
"$STM32_CLI" -c port=SWD mode=HotPlug -ob displ | grep -i WRPSGn1
```

Build wolfTrust with `WT_GUEST_FLASH_WRP=1`. At each required launch,
the Secure port checks that every WRP group covering the full guest window is
protected. A missing bit refuses launch.

To reflash with the supported helper workflow, keep the device Open and clear
WRP:

```sh
WT_LOCK_CONFIRM=1 tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh clear-wrp
```

Then flash and reapply WRP before allowing a hardened image to launch. The
hardware runner performs that clear/program/reapply sequence automatically
when `WT_GUEST_FLASH_WRP=1` is present.

## Build, flash, and verify

For a focused positive run with guest-flash enforcement, pass the flag into the
container build and repeat it for the host-side flash run:

```sh
docker run --rm \
    -e WT_GUEST_FLASH_WRP=1 \
    -v "$PWD":/workspace \
    -w /workspace \
    ghcr.io/wolfssl/wolfboot-ci-m33mu:v1.15 \
    bash tests/target/run_h5_hardware.sh build positive
WT_GUEST_FLASH_WRP=1 \
    tests/target/run_h5_hardware.sh flash positive
```

The suite:

1. builds the matching wolfBoot, wolfTrust, Zephyr, and FreeRTOS images;
2. patches both guest measurement records into wolfTrust;
3. signs wolfTrust;
4. clears WRP if required;
5. flashes all images with verification;
6. restores WRP; and
7. resets the board, captures UART, and checks expected markers.

The current `run_h5_suite.sh` wrapper does not forward
`WT_GUEST_FLASH_WRP` into a Docker build, so do not replace the two-stage command
with the shorter `make test-hardware` form until that runner is fixed. Do not use
the direct-host build path either: it adds `safe.directory '*'` to the user's
global Git configuration. The detector checks the board/programmer path, not
every required host tool. It reports a skip when the CLI or serial VCP is absent
and, when `lsusb` is available, when no ST-Link is detected. Without `lsusb`, a
missing probe appears later as a flash failure.

## Reversible product-state flow

Product-state values used by the control script are:

| State | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| Open | `0xED` |
| Provisioning | `0x17` |
| TrustZone Closed | `0xC6` |
| Closed | `0x72` |
| Locked | `0x5C` |

Locked is permanent and the script refuses it. The reversible development
sequence is deliberately manual:

```sh
tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh status
WT_LOCK_CONFIRM=1 tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh advance 0x17
WT_LOCK_CONFIRM=1 tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh provision-da
tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh discover
WT_LOCK_CONFIRM=1 tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh advance 0x72
WT_LOCK_CONFIRM=1 tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh regress
```

Provision the certificate-based Debug Authentication data in Provisioning.
`discover` performs read-only device discovery; it supplies neither the key nor
certificate and does not authenticate the certificate chain or validate the
regression action. Do not close the device unless the exact certificate chain
and permitted regression action have been validated in a controlled,
recoverable test. Regression performs a full mass-erase back to Open.

After regression, rerun `set-perimeter`, rebuild and flash the complete chain
with the current hardware runner, reapply WRP, and rerun the positive checks.
The `provisioning_ctrl.sh flash` and `restore` commands use the same Guest 1
address, `0x080E0000`, as the hardware runner. Prefer the runner for the full
build, flash, and verification sequence described above.

Every board-writing control command requires `WT_LOCK_CONFIRM=1`.
Review the exact current command in
`tests/target/provisioning_ctrl.sh` before execution.

## Recovery rules

- If guest programming fails, confirm WRP is clear and the product state is
  Open.
- If wolfBoot rejects wolfTrust, confirm the Secure watermark covers the full
  boot partition and that guest records were patched before signing.
- If wolfTrust refuses a guest, compare the built guest address and size with
  the manifest, inspect the signed measurement record, and read back WRP.
- Debug Authentication discovery alone does not validate the regression
  credential or permitted action. Do not close the device until both have been
  tested through the controlled recovery procedure.
- Never use a generic option-byte recipe from another H5 layout; a wrong
  watermark can silently discard flash writes or expose a Secure region.

See [Testing](Testing.md) for scenario selection and [Security Model](Security-Model.md) for the policy
enforced after boot.
